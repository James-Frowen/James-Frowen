## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm James, a software developer who loves contributing to open source projects. I'm currently working on a few projects, including:

- [Mirage](https://github.com/MirageNet/Mirage): A networking library for Unity that is an improvement on [Mirror](https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror). Mirage is optimized and easier to use, making it ideal for creating multiplayer games in Unity.
- [SimpleWebTransport](https://github.com/James-Frowen/SimpleWebTransport): The most popular open source WebSocket transport for Unity, which allows for easy communication between clients and servers over the web.
- [NetworkPositionSync](https://github.com/James-Frowen/NetworkPositionSync): A highly optimized NetworkTransport for Mirror and Mirage 
- [BitPacking](https://github.com/James-Frowen/BitPacking): A C# and Unity library for efficient bit packing and unpacking of data structures.
- [Mirage.Profiler](https://github.com/James-Frowen/Mirage.Profiler): A profiler for Mirage and Mirror that allows for detailed analysis of network traffic and performance.

I'm also available for freelance work, so if you're interested in working with me, feel free to reach out. You can contact me via Discord at JamesDev#1250 or email at jamesfrowendev@gmail.com.
